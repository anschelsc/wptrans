wptrans.py, by Anschel Schaffer-Cohen <anschelsc@gmail.com>

This script will fail if it is run as
$ python3 ./wptrans.py
because sys.argv will be longer than expected. Therefore it should be made executable and run as
$ ./wptrans.py

Usage:
wptrans.py [inlang title [outlang]]
where inlang and outlang are Wikipedia's two- and three-character codes.

Bugs:
As of current Python implentation (3.1.2), this does not seem to work.
I've semi-abandoned this project, so if anyone else has a bugfix that would be welcome.
